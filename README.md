A real-time cryptocurrency price tracker built using **Express.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **CoinGecko API**. This application fetches cryptocurrency prices every 15 seconds and provides real-time updates to users.

## **How It Works**

1. **Real-Time Price Updates**:  
   The server fetches cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API every 15 seconds and sends them to all connected clients. This allows users to see live updates of the top cryptocurrencies.

2. **Set Alerts**:  
   Users can set alerts for specific cryptocurrencies. For example, if you want to be notified when **NEXO** reaches $2, the system will trigger an alert once that condition is met.

3. **Receive Alerts**:  
   When a target price is reached, users will receive a **real-time alert** in their browser with the current price of the coin.
